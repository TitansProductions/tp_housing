# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. Added custom stashes / storages support directly from the Framework (RSG, VORP, TPZCORE). The **TP Containers** from now on will NOT be a dependency but it will exist as optional in case someone prefers to use it.

## Modified Files:

- **ALL SERVER FILES**
- fxmanifest.lua

__Configuration:__

Below `Config.ManagementMenu` add the following option:

```lua
-- Set to false if you dont have TP Containers or want to use the Framework storage system.
-- (!) In case the storage system of your framework is not functional, it might not be supported.
Config.tp_containers = false -- version 1.2.6
```

If you are not going to use TP Containers, make sure to run the query on database below while the server is stopped.

```lua
UPDATE tp_properties
SET containerId = 0;
```

## Notes

`THE SPECIFIED UPDATE REQUIRES TP LIBS 2.0.7+ VERSION.`


`(!) BEFORE UPDATING, ALL CONTENTS WILL BE LOST, MAKE SURE TO LET YOUR PLAYERS TAKE THEIR ITEMS FIRST`

## How to update?

- You can easily update the modified files by redownloading from the **Cfx.re Portal** and copy-paste on the mentioned directory file paths.
- If new options have been implemented to the configuration file or edited, **DO NOT** copy-paste the new configuration file, otherwise you will get the latest configuration but you will lose all the changes you have made. The proper way updating a configuration file is by finding the new configuration options or the modified ones and do it **manually**.

*Cfx.re Portal **DOES NOT** force-update your configuration file or any files, if it did, you would always lose all the configuration changes you made or would totally break the script, all files are updated or edited manually.*
